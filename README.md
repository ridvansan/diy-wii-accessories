# DIY Wii Accessories
Hello everyone. In this project I aim to create the Wii accessories as open source devices. I was planning to create Wii Balance Board via 4 weight sensor and one ESP-32 since balance board is hard to find in my country and I couldn't agree on price with the dealer. So my source will be wiibrew.org and also special thanks to people that put their effort on that site.

My plan is to establish connection between Arduino and Wiimote via I2C then Arduino will act as the Nunchuck. In first step I am not planning to go on compact design or use real sensors etc.
Then I am going to do the same thing for the classic controller. After that I can consider the make these communications useful via real sensor and button data etc.

These are my first things I had in my mind. I am not planning to rush things since I have a heavy work-school schedule. Feel free to contriute things via PR.

Also if you wanna support me, I will really appreciate it: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ridvansan
